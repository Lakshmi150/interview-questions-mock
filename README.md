- **Self Intro**
  - I've been deeply involved in the architecture and management of cloud infrastructure. I've adeptly handled tasks such as provisioning storage 
    accounts, virtual networks, and VM deployments both manually through Azure Portal and automated via Terraform.
  - My expertise extends to implementing robust CI/CD pipelines utilizing a suite of tools like Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and Ansible, ensuring 
    seamless integration and deployment processes.
  - I've played a pivotal role in designing and configuring Azure network components for high availability, including load 
    balancers, NSGs, and VNet/subnet setups. Additionally, I've been instrumental in deploying and maintaining Docker container clusters managed 
    by Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and reliability.
  - Furthermore, my experience encompasses tasks like Azure SQL database management, Azure Backup 
    configuration for VMs, and facilitating the migration of on-premises applications to Azure, ensuring optimal performance and data protection
