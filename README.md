- **What are the components of Kubernates?**
- **How to achive High Availabiity of Cluster**
  Deploy Kubernetes across multiple nodes.
Configure a highly available control plane.
Use a clustered etcd for data storage.
Ensure node redundancy for application rescheduling.
Implement load balancing for traffic distribution.
Deploy applications with multiple replicas.
Configure network redundancy and isolation.
Set up monitoring and alerting for proactive issue detection.
- **Define multi cluster architecutre**
  - 
- **Explain contanirization**
  - Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build 
     container images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container regestries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.
- **explain ansible**
  - Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It simplifies IT 
    operations by allowing users to define infrastructure as code using YAML-based playbooks, which describe desired configurations and tasks. 
    Ansible connects to remote systems over SSH or other protocols, executes tasks in parallel, and ensures consistency and repeatability across 
    infrastructure environments.
- **explain jenkins**
  - Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It automates software building, 
    testing, and deployment processes, supports extensibility through plugins, and enables flexible pipeline orchestration with code-based 
    configurations.
- **Explain gitreset and git revert**
   - `git reset` is used to move the HEAD to a different state, altering commit history (use with caution).
     `git revert` is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by previous commits without altering existing history.
- **explain shell scrpiting**
   - Shell scripting involves writing scripts in a shell language (like Bash) to automate tasks and execute commands in a command-line 
     environment. It's used for automating repetitive tasks, system administration, and customizing system behavior.
- **Explain partitining in devops**
  - Partitioning in DevOps refers to the practice of dividing resources, systems, or workloads into smaller, manageable segments to improve 
    organization, efficiency, and isolation. It involves separating infrastructure, networks, applications, data, and workloads based on specific 
     criteria such as function, team, or environment to streamline operations and enhance scalability, security, and reliability.
- **explain head start command**
  - a "head start" command could be a script or container entry point that performs initialization tasks, such as setting up configuration files, 
   loading initial data, or preparing dependencies, before the main application components start.
